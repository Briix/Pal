# Paletto

> :art: Tiny app for managing color palettes
Paletto aims to be a simple and customizable color palette manager/viewer and does exactly and
only that. On first runs it creates a dotfile in your home directory that will
hold both your settings and your color palettes. 

For now colors can only be added directly in the dotfile.

[Read more about the settings](#user-content-settings).

## Downloads
Paletto currently only runs on macOS and prebuilt binaries can be found on the
relases page.

If you want to build the app yourself or try it out on other platforms,
checkout the [development section](#user-content-dev).

## Settings
Paletto can be customized through its dotfile located at `{HOMEDIR}/.paletto`.

Default: `#333`

### `globalShortcut`
