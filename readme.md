> :art: Tiny app for managing color palettes

Pal aims to be a simple and customizable color palette manager/viewer and does exactly and
only that. On first run it creates a dotfile in your home directory that will
hold both your settings and your color palettes.

For now colors can only be added directly in the dotfile.

[Read more about the settings](#user-content-settings).

## Downloads
Pal currently only runs on macOS and pre-built binaries can be found on the
[releases page](https://github.com/Briix/Pal/releases/).

If you want to build the app yourself or try it out on other platforms,
checkout the [development section](#user-content-dev).
